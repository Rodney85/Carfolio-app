# Clerk Authentication Integration

This document outlines the steps to integrate Clerk authentication with the Carfolio project.

## Current Status

- Clerk authentication has been set up with custom sign-in and sign-up pages
- The authentication flow is working with redirects to the dashboard after successful login
- We've started the Convex integration but are facing some configuration issues

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Clerk Authentication**
   - Ensure all protected routes are working correctly
   - Test the authentication flow end-to-end

2. **Set Up Convex Backend**
   - Run `npx convex init` to properly initialize Convex
   - Update the schema with users, cars, mods, and media tables
   - Create the necessary Convex functions for CRUD operations

3. **Connect Clerk with Convex**
   - Set up the Clerk webhook to sync user data with Convex
   - Implement the authentication middleware for Convex

## Clerk Configuration

- Publishable Key: `pk_test_aGVyb2ljLXdvbGYtMTQuY2xlcmsuYWNjb3VudHMuZGV2JA`
- Issuer: `https://heroic-wolf-14.clerk.accounts.dev`
- JWKS Endpoint: `https://heroic-wolf-14.clerk.accounts.dev/.well-known/jwks.json`

## Convex Configuration

- URL: `https://greedy-duck-163.convex.cloud`
- HTTP Actions URL: `https://greedy-duck-163.convex.site`

## Authentication Flow

1. User visits the landing page
2. User clicks on Sign In or Sign Up
3. User completes the authentication process with Clerk
4. User is redirected to the dashboard
5. Dashboard checks authentication status and displays user data

## Implementation Details

- Custom styled sign-in and sign-up pages
- Protected routes using Clerk's authentication hooks
- Dashboard with user profile information
- Redirects based on authentication state

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Convex integration:

1. Make sure Convex is properly initialized with `npx convex init`
2. Check the Convex configuration in `convex.json`
3. Ensure the environment variables are correctly set in `.env`
4. Review the Clerk webhook configuration for Convex integration
