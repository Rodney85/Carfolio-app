want this full document one at a time
Okay, the user wants to create several documents for their project, starting with the Project Requirement Document. Let me recall what each document typically includes.

First, the Project Requirement Document (PRD) should outline the purpose, features, and scope. The user's app is a Linktree for car enthusiasts, so I need to detail the problem statement, objectives, user roles, features, and non-functional requirements.

I'll start by restating the problem they're solving: eliminating repetitive questions and providing a platform for showcasing car builds. The objectives should align with that, like creating an MVP with user profiles, car cards, and analytics.

Next, user roles. They'll have Creators (car content creators) and Viewers (fans). Features need to be split between these roles. For Creators, profile management, car cards with mod lists, affiliate links, and analytics. Viewers need to view public profiles and interact with car cards.

Monetization is through a freemium model, so I'll mention the Pro tier features. Non-functional requirements should cover performance, scalability, security, and compliance, especially with data protection laws.

I should structure the PRD clearly, using sections like Problem Statement, Objectives, User Roles, Features, etc. Keep it concise but thorough. Maybe use bullet points for readability. Also, make sure to tie each feature back to the core problem they're solving.

Once the PRD is outlined, the user can move on to the next documents. But for now, focusing on a solid PRD is key. I need to ensure that all aspects of their initial idea are covered here so that subsequent documents have a clear foundation.

Let‚Äôs start with the Project Requirement Document (PRD). I‚Äôll draft it step-by-step based on your idea and tech stack.

Ready for the next document? Let me know which one you‚Äôd like to tackle next (e.g., App Flow Document or Tech Stack Document).

generate the next app flow document
Okay, the user asked for the next document, which is the App Flow Document. Let me start by recalling the project's main goals. The app is a Linktree-like platform for car enthusiasts to showcase their builds. The key features include user profiles, car cards with mod details, affiliate links, and analytics.

First, I need to outline the user flows. There are two main user roles: Creators and Viewers. Creators will sign up, manage their profiles, add cars, and view analytics. Viewers will access the public profile via a link, browse cars, and click on affiliate links.

For the App Flow Document, I should break down each user role's journey. Starting with the Creator's onboarding: signing up, setting up their profile, adding cars, and managing content. Then, the Viewer's flow: landing on the public profile, interacting with car cards, and accessing mod details and affiliate links.

I need to visualize these flows step-by-step, maybe using bullet points or a flowchart-like structure. Also, consider edge cases like a new user with no cars yet or a Viewer who wants to share the profile.

Including wireframe references will help the development team understand how each screen connects. Mentioning tools like Figma for wireframing adds practical advice.

I should also highlight key interactions, such as animations when expanding mod lists or hover effects on affiliate links. Performance is crucial, so note that images should load quickly, and the UI must be responsive.

Finally, make sure the document aligns with the previously mentioned tech stack‚Äîusing React, Convex, Clerk, etc. This ensures consistency across all project documents.

Double-check if there are any specific details the user emphasized, like monetization through Pro features and keeping affiliate earnings for users. Make sure the flows support upgrading to Pro and accessing advanced analytics.

Alright, structuring the App Flow Document with clear sections for each user role, step-by-step processes, wireframe references, and key interactions should cover everything. Time to present this in a clear, organized manner.

media flow:"1. Upload Flow:
   - User uploads media ‚Üí Frontend sends file to Backblaze B2 via signed URL
   - Backblaze returns a public URL ‚Üí Store URL in Convex which displays the image in frontend'
Okay, the user is working on building a web app called CarMods, which is like a Linktree for car enthusiasts. They need to handle media uploads, specifically images and videos for car builds. The current task is to outline the media upload flow as described in their message. Let me break down what they provided.

The user mentioned an upload flow where the frontend sends a file to Backblaze B2 using a signed URL, then stores the returned public URL in Convex to display the image. I need to elaborate on this process, making sure each step is clear and covers possible edge cases.

First, I should start by understanding the components involved. The frontend is built with React using Vite, and they're using Backblaze B2 for storage. Convex is the backend/database, and Clerk handles authentication. The user wants a secure and efficient way to upload media files.

The key steps are: generating a signed URL from Backblaze, uploading the file to that URL, storing the public URL in Convex, and then displaying it in the frontend. But I need to think about each step in detail.

Generating a signed URL usually requires some backend logic because it involves using Backblaze's API keys, which shouldn't be exposed on the client side. However, since they're using Convex, which allows server-side functions, maybe the signed URL generation can be handled via a Convex action or mutation. That way, the frontend calls a Convex function that securely communicates with Backblaze to get the signed URL.

Once the frontend gets the signed URL, it can upload the file directly to Backblaze. After the upload, Backblaze provides a public URL, which the frontend then sends back to Convex to store in the database associated with the specific car or user.

I should also consider error handling here. What if the file is too large? What if the upload fails? The user might need to implement checks for file size and type on the frontend before even attempting the upload. Also, providing feedback to the user during the upload process, like a progress bar, would be important for UX.

Another point is security. Using signed URLs is good because it limits the time window during which the upload can occur, reducing the risk of unauthorized uploads. But the backend (Convex) needs to handle generating these URLs securely without exposing API keys.

Additionally, after storing the public URL in Convex, how is it retrieved and displayed? The frontend would query Convex for the car data, which includes the media URLs, and then render them using img tags or video elements.

I should also mention optimizing images. Maybe using a library like sharp.js to compress images before upload, but that would require processing on the frontend or via a Convex function. However, since the user is using Backblaze, maybe they can handle image optimization on their end, or it's something to note as a future enhancement.

Testing is another aspect. They should test the upload flow thoroughly, including cases where the network is slow or the file is corrupted. Also, handling multiple files at once, like uploading several images for a car build.

Finally, the example code they provided uses a Convex mutation to generate the upload URL and another to store the media. The frontend uses react-dropzone for handling drag-and-drop, which is a good choice. I should make sure the code examples are accurate and fit within their tech stack (Vite, React, Convex, Backblaze).

I need to structure the response clearly, starting with an overview, then step-by-step workflow, followed by code examples, edge cases, and maybe future enhancements. The user probably wants to see both the backend (Convex) and frontend (React) parts working together. Also, ensuring that the explanation is thorough but not overly technical, keeping in mind they're building an MVP first.

Wait, the user mentioned using Convex. Convex has its own database and serverless functions, so the signed URL generation should be a Convex action. That makes sense because it keeps the Backblaze API keys secure on the server side. The frontend shouldn't handle any sensitive keys.

Also, in the code example, when the user uploads a file, the frontend first requests a signed URL from Convex. Convex's function (generateUploadUrl) uses the Backblaze B2 SDK to create the signed URL, which is then returned to the frontend. The frontend uses this URL to PUT the file directly to Backblaze. After a successful upload, the public URL is known (since Backblaze URLs are predictable once you have the bucket and file name), so the frontend can send that URL to Convex to store in the database.

But wait, does Backblaze return the public URL after upload, or can it be constructed from the bucket and file name? The user's original message says "Backblaze returns a public URL," but in reality, when you upload a file using the signed URL, the response includes the file ID and other details, from which you can construct the public URL. So the Convex function that generates the signed URL might need to also return the public URL pattern so the frontend can construct it once the upload is complete.

Alternatively, after uploading, the Backblaze response might include the necessary information to build the public URL. The code example should reflect that. Maybe the generateUploadUrl function in Convex not only provides the signed URL but also the base public URL, so the frontend can append the file name to it after upload.

Another thing: the user mentioned storing the URL in Convex. Each car entry in Convex should have an array of media URLs. So when adding a new media item, the frontend calls a Convex mutation to add the URL to that car's media array.

Edge cases to consider: handling different file types (images, videos), maximum file sizes, failed uploads, retries, and user cancellation. Also, displaying upload progress to the user.

In the frontend, using react-dropzone allows for drag-and-drop functionality, which is user-friendly. The example code uses useMutation from Convex to interact with the backend. The onDrop callback handles the file processing, showing a toast for success or error.

Security-wise, ensuring that only authenticated users (via Clerk) can generate upload URLs and that each media URL is associated with their account. Convex's integration with Clerk should handle the authentication state, so mutations can check if the user is logged in before proceeding.

Performance considerations: Uploading files directly from the client to Backblaze reduces server load, as Convex doesn't have to handle the file transfer. This is efficient and scalable.

In the response, I should also mention possible alternatives or additional steps, like using webhooks from Backblaze to confirm the upload completion, but that might complicate the MVP. Since the user is focused on an MVP, keeping it simple with the frontend handling the upload and then updating Convex is acceptable.

Testing this flow is crucial. They should test with different file types, sizes, and network conditions to ensure reliability. Error messages should be user-friendly, guiding them to retry or check their file.

Finally, the code examples should be accurate and reflect the tech stack. Using async/await for the Convex functions, handling errors with try/catch, and updating the UI state accordingly.

Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of the Media Upload Flow for your app, including code examples and edge-case handling:

Media Upload Flow Document
Project Name: CarMods
Version: 1.0

1. Overview
A secure, scalable way for creators to upload car build media (images/videos) to Backblaze B2, with URLs stored in Convex for display.

2. Step-by-Step Workflow
Step 1: User Initiates Upload
Frontend (React): User drags/drops or selects a file (e.g., car.jpg).

Validation: Check file type (image/jpeg, image/png, video/mp4) and size (<50MB).

tsx
// Frontend: File validation (e.g., using react-dropzone)
const { getRootProps } = useDropzone({
  accept: { 'image/*': ['.jpeg', '.png'], 'video/*': ['.mp4'] },
  maxSize: 50_000_000, // 50MB
  onDrop: (files) => handleUpload(files[0]),
});
Step 2: Generate Backblaze Signed URL
Frontend ‚Üí Calls a Convex action to request a secure upload URL.

Convex (Backend): Uses Backblaze B2 API keys to generate a signed URL.

ts
// Convex: Generate signed URL (backend)
import { v } from "convex/values";
import { action } from "./_generated/server";
import { B2 } from "backblaze-b2"; // B2 SDK

const b2 = new B2({
  applicationKeyId: process.env.B2_KEY_ID!,
  applicationKey: process.env.B2_APP_KEY!,
});

export const generateUploadUrl = action({
  args: { fileName: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, { fileName }) => {
    await b2.authorize(); // Authenticate with B2
    const response = await b2.getUploadUrl({ bucketId: process.env.B2_BUCKET_ID! });
    return {
      uploadUrl: response.data.uploadUrl,
      uploadAuthToken: response.data.authorizationToken,
      fileId: response.data.fileId, // For public URL construction
    };
  },
});
Step 3: Upload File to Backblaze B2
Frontend: Directly uploads the file to the signed URL (bypasses your server).

tsx
// Frontend: Upload to Backblaze
const handleUpload = async (file: File) => {
  try {
    // 1. Get signed URL from Convex
    const { uploadUrl, uploadAuthToken, fileId } = await generateUploadUrl({ fileName: file.name });
    
    // 2. Upload file to Backblaze
    const uploadResponse = await fetch(uploadUrl, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authorization: uploadAuthToken,
        "Content-Type": file.type,
        "X-Bz-File-Name": encodeURIComponent(file.name),
      },
      body: file,
    });

    if (!uploadResponse.ok) throw new Error("Upload failed");
    
    // 3. Construct public URL (format: https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/[bucket]/[fileName])
    const publicUrl = `https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/${process.env.B2_BUCKET_NAME}/${file.name}`;
    
    // 4. Save URL to Convex DB
    await ctx.db.insert("media", { url: publicUrl, carId: currentCarId });
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error("Upload failed");
  }
};
Step 4: Store URL in Convex & Display
Convex: Save the public URL to the database under the car‚Äôs media array.

Frontend: Fetch and display images/videos from the stored URL.

tsx
// Frontend: Display media
{car.media.map((media) => (
  media.type === "image" ? (
    <img src={media.url} alt="Car build" className="rounded-lg" />
  ) : (
    <video src={media.url} controls className="rounded-lg" />
  )
))}
3. Edge Cases & Solutions
Scenario	Solution
Duplicate file names	Append timestamp to filename (e.g., car_1234.jpg)
Upload interruption	Retry logic (3 attempts) + progress bar
Corrupted file	Frontend file validation + Convex cleanup cron job
4. Security
Signed URLs: Expire after 24 hours.

CORS: Restrict Backblaze bucket to your app‚Äôs domain.

Auth: Only authenticated users (Clerk) can generate URLs.

5. Future Optimizations
Image Compression: Use sharp.js to resize images pre-upload.

CDN: Serve media via Cloudflare CDN for faster loads.

Okay, the user has been working on creating a series of documents for their CarMods project. So far, they've covered the Project Requirement Document, App Flow Document, and Media Upload Flow. Now, they're asking for the next document. Let me check the list they provided earlier.

The files they mentioned include Tech Stack Document, Frontend Guidelines Document, Backend Structure Document, App Flowchart, Implementation Plan, etc. Since the user just finished the Media Upload Flow, the next logical step would be the Tech Stack Document. It makes sense because they've already outlined their tech stack in a previous interaction, so expanding that into a formal document would be helpful.

I need to structure the Tech Stack Document properly. Start with an overview, then list each component (frontend, backend, etc.), explain why each technology was chosen, and how they integrate. Also, include setup steps and considerations for scalability and security. The user is using Vite+React, Tailwind, Convex, Clerk, etc., so those should be detailed with specific configurations. Adding code snippets or commands will make it practical. Also, addressing future considerations shows foresight. Let me make sure each section is clear and aligns with their existing setup. Need to mention alternatives like No-code options briefly, but focus on their chosen stack. Ensure the document is comprehensive but not too verbose. Check if there are any edge cases or additional tips that could be useful, like performance optimizations or deployment tips.

Media Upload Flow Document
Project Name: CarMods
Version: 1.0

1. Overview
This document outlines the end-to-end process for creators to upload and manage media (images/videos) for their car builds, ensuring fast, secure, and scalable storage with Backblaze B2.

2. User Flow
Step 1: Initiate Upload
Action: Creator clicks "Add Media" in their car build dashboard.

Validation:

File types: .jpg, .png, .mp4 (under 50MB).

Error handling: Rejects unsupported formats with tooltip feedback.

Step 2: Generate Secure Upload URL
Process:

Frontend requests a signed URL from Convex.

Convex calls Backblaze B2 API to generate a time-limited (24h) upload URL.

Security:

Signed URLs restrict uploads to authenticated users only.

Step 3: Direct-to-Backblaze Upload
Frontend: Uploads file directly to Backblaze via the signed URL (bypassing server).

Optimization:

Progress bar shows upload status.

Retries failed uploads (max 3 attempts).

Step 4: Save & Display Media
Backblaze returns a public CDN URL (e.g., https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/carmods-builds/turbo.jpg).

Convex stores the URL in the car‚Äôs media array.

Frontend displays media in the car‚Äôs gallery with lazy loading.

3. Technical Details
Backblaze B2 Configuration
Bucket Policy: Public read-only (for CDN delivery).

CORS: Restricted to your app‚Äôs domain.

Cost Control: Lifecycle rules auto-delete orphaned files after 30 days.

Convex Database Schema
ts
// convex/schema.ts  
cars: defineTable({  
  media: v.array(v.object({  
    url: v.string(),  // Backblaze URL  
    type: v.union(v.literal("image"), v.literal("video")),  
    uploadedAt: v.number(),  
  })),  
})  
4. Edge Cases & Solutions
Scenario	Resolution
Duplicate filenames	Append timestamp (turbo_17123456.jpg).
Slow connection timeout	Chunked uploads (future enhancement).
Malicious file upload	Frontend validation + Backblaze scan (ClamAV).

1. Frontend Guidelines Document
Purpose: Ensure a unified, responsive, and performant UI.

A. Core Principles
Mobile-First Design: 80% of traffic will come from mobile (Instagram/TikTok links).

Performance: Lazy-load media, optimize images (WebP), and minimize JS bundles.

Accessibility: AA contrast ratios, ARIA labels for mod lists.

B. Component Library
Pre-Built Components (shadcn/ui):

CarCard: Swipeable mod lists with expandable sections.

MediaGallery: Grid layout with lazy loading.

Custom Components:

AffiliateLinkButton: Tracks clicks for analytics.

C. Styling (Tailwind)
Themes: Dark mode (default) + light mode.

Spacing: Consistent 4px base unit.

Animations: Framer Motion for card hover effects (whileHover={{ scale: 1.03 }}).

D. State Management
Convex Hooks: useQuery for car data, useMutation for edits.

Data Schema Document
Project Name: CarMods
Version: 1.0

1. Core Tables (Convex DB)
Users
ts
defineTable({
  clerkUserId: v.string(),           // From Clerk auth
  username: v.string(),             // @turbo_kev
  email: v.string(),                // Used for Paystack billing
  isPro: v.boolean(),               // Premium tier flag
  subscriptionId: v.optional(v.string()), // Paystack ID
  createdAt: v.number(),            // Unix timestamp
})
Cars
ts
defineTable({
  userId: v.id("users"),            // Owner reference
  name: v.string(),                 // "Project RX-7"
  make: v.string(),                 // Mazda
  model: v.string(),                // RX-7 FD
  year: v.number(),                 // 1995
  status: v.union(
    v.literal("Building"),
    v.literal("Completed"),
    v.literal("For Sale")
  ),
  mods: v.array(
    v.object({
      category: v.string(),         // Engine, Suspension, etc.
      name: v.string(),             // "Garrett GTX3584RS"
      brand: v.string(),            // "Garrett"
      link: v.optional(v.string()), // Affiliate URL
      notes: v.optional(v.string()) // "Tuned to 24psi"
    })
  ),
  media: v.array(
    v.object({
      url: v.string(),              // Backblaze B2 URL
      type: v.union(
        v.literal("image"),
        v.literal("video")
      ),
      uploadedAt: v.number()
    })
  ),
  isPublic: v.boolean()             // Hide WIP builds
})
Analytics
ts
defineTable({
  carId: v.id("cars"),              // Which car was viewed
  viewerId: v.optional(v.string()), // Clerk ID if logged in
  eventType: v.union(
    v.literal("profile_view"),
    v.literal("car_click"),
    v.literal("link_click")
  ),
  referrer: v.optional(v.string()), // Instagram, TikTok, etc.
  timestamp: v.number()
})
2. Security Rules
Authentication
All mutations require valid Clerk userId.

Users can only edit their own cars/profile.

Validation
Convex schema enforces:

Required fields (make, model, etc.).

Correct URL formats for media/links.

3. Indexes for Performance
ts
// convex/schema.ts
export default defineSchema({
  users: defineTable({
    // ...fields...
  }).index("by_clerkUserId", ["clerkUserId"]),

  cars: defineTable({
    // ...fields...
  })
    .index("by_userId", ["userId"])
    .index("by_public_status", ["isPublic", "status"]),
})
4. Example Queries
Get a User's Public Cars
ts
// convex/cars.ts
export const getUserPublicCars = query({
  args: { userId: v.string() },
  handler: async (ctx, { userId }) => {
    return await ctx.db
      .query("cars")
      .withIndex("by_userId", q => q.eq("userId", userId))
      .filter(q => q.eq(q.field("isPublic"), true))
      .collect();
  },
});
